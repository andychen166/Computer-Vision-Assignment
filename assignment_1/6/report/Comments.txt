Comments about the answer :

In the third case, when we added gaussian noise we got error of ~6%
Calculate the error between the original (without noise) image and 
the one calculated by using matrix M.

Whereas in the second case we got error of about 0.15% .This reult is
obvious, since due to addition of noise the mapping between image
coordinate and 3d object point gets less accurate.

In the first case, we get a very small error ~0 . It is our speculation 
that in this case the data given was perfectly matched (i.e. mapping
between image coordinate and 3d object point)
