-If we zoom in or zoom out in the video then we can't estimate its motion using our motion model.
-If we have a high illumination changes between two frames( means light is suddenly turned ON or OFF).
-If we don't have any overlapping area between the 2 frames (such as change of scene) then we can't 
 find the matched points between the frames hence we can't estimate the relative motion.
-In case of very weak feature points (means constant intensity region),we will have very less feature
 points and if it gets less than the degree of freedom of our motion model then we can't estimate 
 the motion either.
